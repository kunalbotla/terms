Project Boom is to use the Donated Equipment directly by refurbishing them and providing them according to its mission or indirectly using them for parts or liquidating them. If and only if after 30 days of receiving them, Project Boom identifies that it cannot use the Donated Equipment directly, it can use them indirectly. Project Boom will value the devices for its records and insurance. Use of Donation Equipment will also be regulated by the Terms of Donation found on https://terms.projectboom.org/donation/device (“Terms of Donation online”).
